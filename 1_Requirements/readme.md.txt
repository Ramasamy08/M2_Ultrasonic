## ULTRASONIC SENSOR WITH ATmega328 MICROPROCESSOR
The project as the name suggests is based on Ultrasonic sensors.Ultrasonic sensors work by sending out a sound wave at a frequency above the range of human hearing. Our ultrasonic sensors, like many others, use a single transducer to send a pulse and to receive the echo. The sensor determines the distance to a target by measuring time lapses between the sending and receiving of the ultrasonic pulse.

## Features,Hardware and Software
1]  SimulIDE provides AVR, Arduino and PIC microcontrollers that can be accessed just like other components. 
  - Features like gpsim and simavr allow you to use PIC and AVR microcontrollers, respectively.
2] AVR:
  - An automatic voltage regulator (AVR) is an electronic device that maintains a constant voltage level to electrical equipment on the same load.
  - The AVR regulates voltage variations to deliver constant, reliable power supply.
