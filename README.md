# ULTRASONIC SENSOR

*  This project is used to measure distance

## Installation Softwares

*   SIMULIDE.
*   codeblocks.
*   GitHub desktop(To push and pull the changes without command through GIT BASH).

## Flow Chart


![App Screenshot]()


## Procedure
* when in normal stage it displays nothing.
* when the supply is given is activates the ultrasonic sensor'
* Ultrasonic sensors work by sending out a sound wave at a frequency above the range of human hearing. The transducer of the sensor acts as a microphone to receive and send the ultrasonic sound. Our ultrasonic sensors, like many others, use a single transducer to send a pulse and to receive the echo.
* it displays the distance

## For Testing and using code

* You have to use Code blocks to run the program
* Simulide for simulation purposes.
