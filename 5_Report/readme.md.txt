## ULTRASONIC SENSOR WITH ATmega328 MICROPROCESSOR
The project as the name suggests is based on Ultrasonic sensors.Ultrasonic sensors work by sending out a sound wave at a frequency above the range of human hearing. Our ultrasonic sensors, like many others, use a single transducer to send a pulse and to receive the echo. The sensor determines the distance to a target by measuring time lapses between the sending and receiving of the ultrasonic pulse.

## Features,Hardware and Software
1] SimulIDE
   - SimulIDE provides AVR, Arduino and PIC microcontrollers that can be accessed just like other components. 
  - Features like gpsim and simavr allow you to use PIC and AVR microcontrollers, respectively.
2] AVR:
  - An automatic voltage regulator (AVR) is an electronic device that maintains a constant voltage level to electrical equipment on the same load.
  - The AVR regulates voltage variations to deliver constant, reliable power supply.
SOFTWARE :-
1] ATmega328:
  - ATmega328 is commonly used in many projects and autonomous systems where a simple, low-powered, low-cost micro-controller is needed
  - Perhaps the most common implementation of this chip is on the popular Arduino development platform.
2] Sound:
  - A sound sensor is defined as a module that detects sound waves through its intensity and converting it to electrical signals.
3] Display:
  - A display device is an output device for presentation of information in visual or tactile form.
SWOT ANALYSIS:-
a) Strength:
The distance to an obstacle can be measured with the low cost ultrasonic sensor . The sensors can measure distances form 2 to 400cm with an accuracy of 3mm. This sensors module includes ultrasonic transmitter, ultrasonic receiver and control circuit.

b) Weakness:
Although we fully believe in the capability of our sensors, we understand that ultrasonics are not suited for every application. Focuses of low thickness, similar to froth and fabric, have a tendency to assimilate sound vitality; these materials may be hard to sense at long range.

c) Opportunity:
This project Can be used as parking assistance systems in vehicles with high power ultrasonic transmitter. This Project Can be used as burglar alarm with suitable additional software for homes and offices.

d) Threats :
Ultrasonic sensors must view a surface (particularly a hard, level surface) unequivocally (oppositely) to get adequate sound reverberation. Additionally, solid detecting requires a base target surface range, which is indicated for every sensor sort. If connection is wrong there might be chances of short-circuit
