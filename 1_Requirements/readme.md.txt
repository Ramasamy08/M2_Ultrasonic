#Requirements

##Introduction
The main Aim of this project to help the Blind people.Using this process the opposite objects,or the humans can be easily detected.Here we used only the basic process of sensors This is the simple and effective projects for the blind peoples . Now days the percentage of blindness can be increasing shortly . we make this mini process of the ultrasonic sensors . This is simple and low cost product which can be low maintenence product compared to the other products. This usage of this process can be deliverable into an complete products like Smart Glass ,and walking stick.

##Defines the project
Ultrasonic sensor “HC-SR04” provides an output signal proportional to distance based on the echo. The sensor here generates a sound vibration in ultrasonic range upon giving a trigger, after that it waits for the sound vibration to return.

##Features
 * It Has an weather assistance it will works in any weathers .
 * LCD used in this projects will give some clear informations to the users.

##Components Used

 * Atmega328
 * HC-SR04 (Ultrasonic) sensor
 * LCD display
 * Switches
 * Power Supply
